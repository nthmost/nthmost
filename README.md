## 🚀 About Me Professionally

I'm a passionate Principal Software Engineer with over 15 years of experience in developing innovative solutions and leading cross-functional teams. I have a strong background in bioinformatics, open-source projects, and software engineering, with a focus on driving impactful technological advancements.

## 🎨 About Me Artistically

I love blending technology with art, creating tech-infused pieces for immersive theater events. My work often explores the intersection of data and narrative, bringing new dimensions to storytelling through interactive installations.

### Tech-Infused Art Projects

- **[Artery Thermal](https://github.com/nthmost/artery-thermal)**: What if CVS receipts were art?  What if a "90s-era AI" (Markov chains) generated "experiences" and fake coupons on those receipts? All the answers you never wanted in this repo!
