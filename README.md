## 🎨 About Me Artistically

For the past decade I've been enhancing art with technology in the immersive theater world, leading project teams of 5 to 20 artists twice a year.  I delight in designing and build venues where people can explore, interact, discover, and co-creatae. My work often explores the intersection of data and narrative, bringing new dimensions to storytelling through interactive installations.

### Tech-Infused Art Projects

Most of my art doesn't store in a github repo -- I sure would save on studio and storage costs if it did! -- but here are the few that do.

- **[Artery Thermal](https://github.com/nthmost/artery-thermal)**: What if CVS receipts were art?  What if a "90s-era AI" (Markov chains) generated "experiences" and fake coupons on those receipts? All the answers you never wanted in this repo!

Contributor, Former Bug Marshal

As Streamlit's 6th full-time engineer, I optimized the Streamlit memory caching system and developed novel media-related features.
