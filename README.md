## 🧙‍♀️ Where I'm from as an engineer

I'm a passionate Principal Software Engineer with strong TPM, EM, and developer relations chops, sporting over 15 years of experience in The Biz, and more than 25 years of just generally getting good at [hooking stuff up to other stuff](https://web.archive.org/web/20010810063846/http://hotwired.lycos.com/members/97/48/geek0a.html). 

🖥️ I taught myself to code in BASIC on the Apple IIe when I was 10.  Then I taught myself Perl, Python, and PHP, figured out how to store and query data in MySQL, and ran it all on my own Linux server with Apache2, Icecast, and Asterisk for fun and occasional profit.

My grandmother, [Kay McNulty Mauchly Antonelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Antonelli), taught me how to program the ENIAC -- because she co-created its programming language.  Kay Mauchly is also credited with the co-invention of [the Subroutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_programming)) along with her husband [John Mauchly, the co-inventor of the ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mauchly) (my grandfather).  

☘️ Kay's first language was Irish (Gaeilge) ☘️.  I miss her intensely, so in her memory, I've devoted myself to learning to speak Irish fluently.  And since it's super challenging learning any minority language, I've been working on a PeerTube based website as a platform for minority language learners to find recordings of native speakers to learn from.

## 🎨 About Me Artistically

For the past decade I've been enhancing art with technology in the immersive theater world, leading project teams of 5 to 20 artists twice a year.  I delight in designing and build venues where people can explore, interact, discover, and co-creatae. My work often explores the intersection of data and narrative, bringing new dimensions to storytelling through interactive installations.

### Tech-Infused Art Projects

Most of my art doesn't store in a github repo -- I sure would save on studio and storage costs if it did! -- but here are the few that do.

- **[Artery Thermal](https://github.com/nthmost/artery-thermal)**: What if CVS receipts were art?  What if a "90s-era AI" (Markov chains) generated "experiences" and fake coupons on those receipts? All the answers you never wanted in this repo!
